# Parking regulations in San Francisco

Our dataset consists of parking regulations types that are applied in San Francisco. 

Working with dataset is basically divided into two major parts:
1. First part consists of BASIC [dataset analysis](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/wiki/Data-analysis) and [data cleaning](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/wiki/Cleaning-data---OSM) - these are the small steps that were discussed during consultations.<br>You can also take a look on the summary of our discussions: [Wiki Page](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/wiki/Meetings-summary).
2. Second part is where it all happens! Here can be found the whole process of:
- preparing dataset, 
- thinking of machine learning, 
- dealing with problems 
- and finally the learning process. 

The code for second part can be found here: [FinalProject.ipynb](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/blob/main/FinalProject.ipynb). 
<br>CleaningData.ipynb and PreparingDataToML.ipynb files were used during the creation process as a suuport for us - they don't require any further attention. Theirs' code is already included in [FinalProject.ipynb](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/blob/main/FinalProject.ipynb).

The runnable script can be found here: [FinalProject.py](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/blob/main/FinalProject.py).

Here is also the final result of notebook: [FinalProject.md](https://github.com/PiotrSzczachor/Parking-regulations-in-San-Francisco---Data-Engineering-project/blob/main/FinalProject.md).
